rules:

This game currently supports multiplayer between two players. Before a player's turn, they will need to press the "I'm Ready!" button, 
allowing them to move their units and let the units take actions. 
At the end of a player's turn, they can click the "Next Turn" button, allowing the other player to come on the computer and start their turn. 
Between some turns, various AI units will also move. 
 
During a player's turn, they can click on their units to select them, which will both highlight that unit to let you know it is selected, and create a magenta circle 
around them which indicates the distance that unit can move during its turn. 
Right clicking the ground anywhere within that circle will make that unit move around, but only within its movement range. 
To take an action, right click a resource or other unit depending on what type of unit that is taking the action 
(ex. Bowmen can only take action on enemy units to attack them). 
Only one action can be taken per turn (on any given unit). 
If you collect enough resources, you can spawn units, consuming the prompted amount of resources. 
These units can take action on the next turn.
