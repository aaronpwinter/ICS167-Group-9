Left click, or click and drag over an area to select a unit or group of units, respectively. Selected units are those with a circle under their feet, and these selected units can be moved by right clicking where you would like them to go. Right clicking on an enemy unit will make selected units automatically attack that enemy until they are manually made to stop (either by moving somewhere else or attacking a different unit). Selected units can similarly be made to collect resources by right clicking a resource.

To spawn units, click the respective unit on the spawning UI, and that unit will appear at the feet of your player. This will expend resources to do so. These units are selectable just like any other, and can attack and move along with that.

To win, defeat the enemy player unit.
